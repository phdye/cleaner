cleaner â€” automatically remove unwanted files

Usage: cleaner [options] [-v...] [ <directory> ...]

The cleaner utility searches through the filesystem for "temporary files"
which can be deleted safely.

Options :
  --debug        Show internal handling such as parsed arguments.
  -v, --verbose  Show additional processing info.
  -h, --help     Show this usage message.
  --version      Show version and exit.

Python implementation of Chris Newel's niftyclean (late 80's at CMUCS).
Or, per the source clean-1.4, perhaps originally written by Jay Leafer.
